My First CSS-Based Website Project (2022)

This project is one of my earliest attempts at building a basic website using only HTML and CSS — without any frameworks, JavaScript, or external tools.
I created this project in 2022, using only Notepad and a web browser, which helped me understand fundamental concepts such as:

Page layout and div structure

CSS positioning and styling

Navigation menu design using images

Background images and hover effects

Basic typography and visual hierarchy

Although simple, this project represents an important step in my web development journey.
It is where I first explored how design and code come together to create a visual interface.
